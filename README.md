OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI OS , which consolidates various AI modules in one place for your personal use.

## **Project Introduction**

The goal of OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is to create a Personal AI OS , which provides a runtime environment for various Al modules as well as protocols for interoperability between them. With OpenDAN, users can securely collaborate with various AI modules using their private data to create powerful personal AI agents, such as butler, lawyer, doctor, teacher, assistant, girl or boy friends.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.

## **Updates**

### 1. Adding Knowledge Base Infrastructure
We're currently working on implementing the infrastructure for the Knowledge Base, aiming to enhance AI agent's access to Personal Data stored on Personal Servers. Leveraging these new features, we want to empower everyone to build their own personal homepage in the AI era using OpenDAN.

### 2. Development Based on SourceDAO Contract
We are in the process of developing the OpenDAN's DAO page, which is based on the SourceDAO contract. The future of OpenDAN should be determined by the community.

### 3. Welcoming waterflier as a Core Contributor
We're excited to officially invite waterflier to join as a core contributor to our community. We recognize and appreciate his innovative ideas and deep insights in the realm of Personal AI OS. Waterflier will be spearheading the development of the MVP version. As a key contributor to the CYFS CoreDev Team, he brings extensive experience in the domain of Personal Servers.
