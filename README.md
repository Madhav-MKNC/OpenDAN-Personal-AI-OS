OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI OS , which consolidates various AI modules in one place for your personal use.

## **Project Introduction**

The goal of OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is to create a Personal AI OS , which provides a runtime environment for various Al modules as well as protocols for interoperability between them. With OpenDAN, users can securely collaborate with various AI modules using their private data to create powerful personal AI agents, such as butler, lawyer, doctor, teacher, assistant, girl or boy friends.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.

## **Updates**

I've just refactored Jarvis's code, leveraging the `functions` support from ChatGPT. As a result, Jarvis now responds much faster and has more stable selection for the functional module. I encourage you to checkout the updated code to experience these improvements firsthand.
